# Credit_Card_Approval_Rejection_Prediction
This project analyzes credit card approval data to understand key risk factors and build a predictive model for approval decisions. The goal is to reduce financial risk by minimizing false approvals while maintaining explainable and business driven insights.

Exploratory analysis was performed using Tableau for clear, stakeholder friendly visualizations, while machine learning models were built using Python.
